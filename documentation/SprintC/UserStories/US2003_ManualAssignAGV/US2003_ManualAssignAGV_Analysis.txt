	* Q: In US4002 it is required that the AGV Manager should support automatic assignment of orders to AGVs. In US2003 the Warehouse Employee will be able to
    	assign any order to an AGV available. If the orders are being automatically assigned to an AGV (US4002) how can the Warehouse Employee assign a specific
    	order to an AGV?

        R:Usually, and by default, one intends that system automatically assigns orders to AGVs (US 4002).

          However, if such option is not available (e.g.: turned off) or by some reason an order needs to be prepared faster than it would normally be, the warehouse
          employee has the ability to assign tasks manually (US 2003).

          Notice that, orders that can be prepared by AGVs are being added to a queue following a FIFO algorithm (part of the US 4002). In the scope of US 2003 the
          FIFO algorithm does not apply... the employee might choose the order (s)he wants.


    * Q: Knowing that in US2003 it is only mentioned that the Warehouse Employee will do this action, I would like to know if it is part of the System to allow
        users with greater skills and responsibilities (Warehouse Managers or Admins) to also perform the same task? If yes, which users?

      R:No! There is not such need.

    * Q: Regarding this feature, what would you consider to be its complete state, that is, what would be the criterion to define whether or not this feature was functional?

      R: The warehouse employee is able to (i) select an order that needs to be prepared; (ii): select the AGV from the ones that are available and able to perform the task;
      (iii) the task is sent to the selected AGV and (iv) the order change its status.

    * Q: It is mentioned that the warehouse is able to force a certain task to a certain AGV, but can this only happen when the AGV is free, or can the warehouse
        employee cancel a task and assign a new one.

      R: In the scope of US 2003, the AGV is selected by the warehouse employee from the ones that are available and are able to perform the task.
      Tasks cannot be manually cancelled.

      * Q: Regarding US2003, the development team was wondering if the warehouse employee chooses the intended AGV available to prepare the specific order or if it
      should be assigned to any AGV available without even asking the warehouse employee.

        R: In the scope of US 2003, the AGV is selected by the warehouse employee from the ones that are available and are able to perform the task.
