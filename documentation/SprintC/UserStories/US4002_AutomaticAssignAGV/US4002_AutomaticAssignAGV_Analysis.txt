	* Q: In US4002 it is required that the AGV Manager should support automatic assignment of orders to AGVs. In US2003 the Warehouse Employee will be able to
	assign any order to an AGV available. If the orders are being automatically assigned to an AGV (US4002) how can the Warehouse Employee assign a specific order to an AGV?

    R:Usually, and by default, one intends that system automatically assigns orders to AGVs (US 4002).

      However, if such option is not available (e.g.: turned off) or by some reason an order needs to be prepared faster than it would normally be, the warehouse
      employee has the ability to assign tasks manually (US 2003).

      Notice that, orders that can be prepared by AGVs are being added to a queue following a FIFO algorithm (part of the US 4002). In the scope of US 2003 the
      FIFO algorithm does not apply... the employee might choose the order (s)he wants.
